  interact with the publicly available RevoDeployR R Web Service APIs.

DEPENDENCIES

  RevoDeployR UI Libraries makes use of the YUI 2.8.1 Connection Manager, JSON Utility, 
  and their dependencies. The YUI libs. can be replaced (rather easily) with other 
  JavaScript toolkits by swaping the contents of deployR-transaction.js file which 
  just wraps the YUI Connection Manager for the AJAX, with the implementation details 
  of your favorite AJAX toolkit.
